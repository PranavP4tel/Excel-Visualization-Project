# Excel-Visualization-Project

Worked on an excel file containing fields: ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age & Puchased Bike.

Aim: To create pivot tables and comprehensive visualizations in excel to understand the response for purchasing a bike, and derive insights from the same.

Work accomplished:
1. Removed duplicates from the data
2. Standardized the values for Marital Status, Gender
3. Converted Age and Income into ranges for better visualization
4. Created pivot tables to understand how factors such as Age, Gender, Commute Distance and more affect the response
5. Created charts for visualizations based on Pivot tables
6. Created Slicers to filter the data based on criterion: Bike Purchased Response, Education, Home owner and Gender
7. Created a dashboard comprising of the visualization and slicers
